# here I am collecting data from the user using the input funtions then storing that data in variables called num1 and num2.
num1 = input("Please enter any number here for A: ")
num2 = input("Please enter another number here for B: ")

# here I am simply swoping the values of the variables above into new variables in order to swope their values.
new_num1 = num2
new_num2 = num1

# here I am using the print funtion to print out the newly swoped variables values to show that I have swoped theii values.
print(f"You have assigned {num1} for A and {num2} for B")
print(f"However I have swoped them around and now A has the value of {new_num1} and B has the value of {new_num2}")
